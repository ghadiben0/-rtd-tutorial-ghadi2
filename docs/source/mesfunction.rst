How **MES** works?
=========================

The **MES** system serves as a smart layer between **Shop Floor** users and the Infor **LN** ERP system, enabling real-time visibility and control of production activities. 

Users begin by accessing the **MES** platform with credentials provided by the system administrator. These credentials are tied to specific user roles.
