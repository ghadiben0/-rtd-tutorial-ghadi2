What is MES?
=========================


A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is a digital solution that connects, monitors, and controls manufacturing processes on the **Shop Floor**. 

The system acts as the bridge between enterprise-level systems which is Infor **LN** ERP and the actual machinery and operations taking place in real time.

MES system provides fast integration capabilities, and flexible interfaces that addresses the need of the manufacturers which leverages:

- Enhanced user experience through fast, responsive, and intuitive interfaces.

- Seamless integration with ERP systems for real-time data synchronization.

- Scalable architecture that evolves with production demands.

- Easier customization and extension based on the factory’s unique requirements.


A modern MES doesn’t just record production data — it provides actionable insights, supports real-time visibility, and enables intelligent automation on the **Shop Floor**. This not only reduces downtime and improves efficiency, but also empowers supervisors and operators with this system what they need to make faster and smarter decisions.
